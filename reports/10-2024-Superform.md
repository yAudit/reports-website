## Review Summary

**Superform Router Plus and Super Vaults**

The Superform Router Plus is a set of contracts in the Superform core project that enable rebalance between different Superform positions.

The Superform Super Vaults project implements a Yearn-based vault with a strategy based on multiple Superform positions. It uses the Superform Router Plus contracts to perform rebalances between those positions.

The contracts of the Superform Router Plus [Repo](https://github.com/superform-xyz/superform-core) and Superform SuperVaults [Repo](https://github.com/superform-xyz/SuperVaults) were reviewed over eight days. The code review was performed by two auditors between 2nd October and 11th October 2024. The repository was under active development during the review, but the review was limited to commit [f7f06d763a6af148899e9c292f1a57414db60cc3](https://github.com/superform-xyz/superform-core/tree/f7f06d763a6af148899e9c292f1a57414db60cc3/src/router-plus) for Superform Router Plus and commit [99382c369aa68a2e5666e2ee4045f32cd8bc3f3e](https://github.com/superform-xyz/SuperVaults/tree/99382c369aa68a2e5666e2ee4045f32cd8bc3f3e) for Superform Super Vaults.

## High Findings

### 1. High - A malicious processor can take advantage of the refund mechanism

`completeCrossChainRebalance()` completes a cross-chain rebalance initiated by the user with `startCrossChainRebalance()`. This function could be called only by an address with a `ROUTER_PLUS_PROCESSOR_ROLE`. As the processor can pass arbitrary data as function arguments to both functions, he can take advantage of the refund mechanism, leading to two possible scenarios:

1. Processor can force unnecessary refunds in `completeCrossChainRebalance()`: passing a specific expectedAmountInterimAsset can force unnecessary refunds on every payload to be processed.
2. The processor can steal all `SuperformRouterPlusAsync` funds: by starting a cross-chain rebalance himself and thus passing a fake `expectedAmountInterimAsset`, he can issue a refund to himself, stealing funds from the `SuperformRouterPlusAsync` contract.

#### Technical Details

**First scenario**

When calling [`completeCrossChainRebalance()`](https://github.com/superform-xyz/superform-core/blob/f7f06d763a6af148899e9c292f1a57414db60cc3/src/router-plus/SuperformRouterPlusAsync.sol#L221-L415), the processor can specify `args_.amountReceivedInterimAsset`. This value can be set lower than the expected minimum amount, calculated as: `data.expectedAmountInterimAsset * (ENTIRE_SLIPPAGE - data.slippage)`. Setting this value artificially low can trigger a refund on the processed payload, even if the received funds have passed the intended slippage checks.

Since the superform router handles slippage protection when bringing tokens to the contract, the funds received are already subject to bridge and swap fees by third parties. While completing the rebalance, further slippage protection is needed only to check that the amount specified by the processor is not maliciously lowered. Given this, refunds will not be necessary, and if the slippage checks do not pass, the functions should simply revert.

**Second scenario**

Starting a rebalance process with [`startCrossChainRebalance()`](https://github.com/superform-xyz/superform-core/blob/f7f06d763a6af148899e9c292f1a57414db60cc3/src/router-plus/SuperformRouterPlus.sol#L128), the processor can craft a fake `expectedAmountInterimAsset`. This can be done because there are no checks to `args.expectedAmountInterimAsset` passed to `startCrossChainRebalance()`. The parameter is finally set [here](https://github.com/superform-xyz/superform-core/blob/f7f06d763a6af148899e9c292f1a57414db60cc3/src/router-plus/SuperformRouterPlus.sol#L189C45-L189C76) and rescued by `completeCrossChainRebalance()` [here](https://github.com/superform-xyz/superform-core/blob/f7f06d763a6af148899e9c292f1a57414db60cc3/src/router-plus/SuperformRouterPlusAsync.sol#L235).

When then calling [`completeCrossChainRebalance()`](https://github.com/superform-xyz/superform-core/blob/f7f06d763a6af148899e9c292f1a57414db60cc3/src/router-plus/SuperformRouterPlusAsync.sol#L221-L415), he can specify an arbitrary `args_.amountReceivedInterimAsset`.

Given this, he can pass the [negative slippage check](https://github.com/superform-xyz/superform-core/blob/f7f06d763a6af148899e9c292f1a57414db60cc3/src/router-plus/SuperformRouterPlusAsync.sol#L242-L247) and enter the refund if block, where he can issue a refund to himself with the fake `data.expectedAmountInterimAsset` amount.

The last step, calling [`finalizeRefund()`](https://github.com/superform-xyz/superform-core/blob/f7f06d763a6af148899e9c292f1a57414db60cc3/src/router-plus/SuperformRouterPlusAsync.sol#L450), he transfers the funds to himself.

}
```

#### Impact

High. A malicious processor can steal all funds from the `SuperformRouterPlusAsync` contract, issuing a refund to himself or disrupting the core functionality of `completeCrossChainRebalance()`.

#### Recommendation

Remove the refund mechanism from `completeCrossChainRebalance()` and modify it to revert if the slippage check fails. Subsequently, refactor the entire refund system. Consider implementing an external `requestRefund()` function to initiate the refund process that must be followed by an `approveRefund()`. This approach would only isolate refund capabilities to users and the `CORE_STATE_REGISTRY_RESCUER_ROLE` owner.

#### Developer Response

Fixed in https://github.com/superform-xyz/superform-core/pull/639.

## Low Findings

### 1. Low - Missing checks for `msg.value` in `startCrossChainRebalance()`

`startCrossChainRebalance()` initiates a cross-chain rebalance that the keeper must complete with `completeCrossChainRebalance()`. The total fee is paid throughout the first call and needs to be the sum of `rebalanceFromMsgValue` and `rebalanceToMsgValue`. However, while in the same chain, rebalance functions, there is a check for this scenario; it is absent here.

#### Technical Details

When calling the superform router in [`startCrossChainRebalance()`](https://github.com/superform-xyz/superform-core/blob/f7f06d763a6af148899e9c292f1a57414db60cc3/src/router-plus/SuperformRouterPlus.sol#L176-L178), `msg.value` is passed under the assumption that it equals the sum of `rebalanceFromMsgValue` and `rebalanceToMsgValue`.

However, there are no checks to ensure this equality. Two scenarios can arise:

1. **Insufficient value**: `msg.value` could be lower than required, potentially even zero. This leads to no fee being passed to the paymaster contract. As a result, the keeper will not execute the transaction on the destination chain.
2. **Excess value**: `msg.value` could be greater than the required fee. In this case, the user loses the excess native sent, which is transferred to the superform paymaster contract.

#### Impact

Low. Users may need additional steps to move their tokens or lose excess native sent.

#### Recommendation

Insert `msg.value` checks similar to the ones in [`_beforeRebalanceChecks()`](https://github.com/superform-xyz/superform-core/blob/f7f06d763a6af148899e9c292f1a57414db60cc3/src/router-plus/SuperformRouterPlus.sol#L558-L560) and in [`_refundUnusedAndResetApprovals()`](https://github.com/superform-xyz/superform-core/blob/f7f06d763a6af148899e9c292f1a57414db60cc3/src/router-plus/SuperformRouterPlus.sol#L590-L597).

#### Developer Response

Acknownledged.

### 2. Low - `deposit4626()` will revert if trying to redeem `stETH`

`deposit4626()` is used to redeem vault assets and deposit them in a superform vault. However, in `_redeemShare()`, there is a strict equality balance check that will always revert in the case of `stETH`.

#### Technical Details

Lido `stETH` has a known problem with rounding down, as stated in their [docs](https://docs.lido.fi/guides/lido-tokens-integration-guide/#1-2-wei-corner-case). When trying to redeem `stETH` with [`deposit4626()`](https://github.com/superform-xyz/superform-core/blob/f7f06d763a6af148899e9c292f1a57414db60cc3/src/router-plus/SuperformRouterPlus.sol#L356-L390), the [balance check](https://github.com/superform-xyz/superform-core/blob/f7f06d763a6af148899e9c292f1a57414db60cc3/src/router-plus/SuperformRouterPlus.sol#L522) will always fail leading the function to revert.

#### Impact

Low. It is not possible to use `deposit4626()` with a `stETH` vault and any other token that has similar behaviour.

#### Recommendation

Avoid using strict equality and insert a tolerance in the balance check to handle the 1-2 wei corner case in the same way you did [here](https://github.com/superform-xyz/superform-core/blob/f7f06d763a6af148899e9c292f1a57414db60cc3/src/forms/ERC5115Form.sol#L30-L31).

#### Developer Response

Fixed in https://github.com/superform-xyz/superform-core/pull/649.

## Gas Saving Findings

### 1. Gas - Optimize for loops

#### Technical Details

Some loops can be optimized to save gas:

- [`_calculateAmounts()`](https://github.com/superform-xyz/SuperVaults/blob/99382c369aa68a2e5666e2ee4045f32cd8bc3f3e/src/SuperVault.sol#L506-L518)
- [`_filterNonZeroWeights()`](https://github.com/superform-xyz/SuperVaults/blob/99382c369aa68a2e5666e2ee4045f32cd8bc3f3e/src/SuperVault.sol#L525-L551)

#### Impact

Gas savings.

#### Recommendation

Optimize for loops by applying these changes:

- don't initialize the loop counter variable, as there is no need to initialize it to zero because it is the default value
- cache the array length outside a loop as it saves reading it on each iteration
- increment `i` variable with `++i` statement

#### Developer Response

Fixed in https://github.com/superform-xyz/SuperVaults/pull/7 and https://github.com/superform-xyz/SuperVaults/pull/17.

### 2. Gas - Fail earlier in `completeCrossChainRebalance()`

#### Technical Details

In the `completeCrossChainRebalance()` function, an if-else block checks against `data.rebalanceSelector`. However, if none of the conditions in this block are met, the function continues to execute. The subsequent `_deposit` call will fail because none of the router function signatures are matched. It would be more gas-efficient to fail earlier in this scenario.

#### Impact

Gas savings.

#### Recommendation

Insert a last else in the if-else block:

```solidity
else {
    revert INVALID_REBALANCE_SELECTOR();
}
```

#### Developer Response

Fixed in https://github.com/superform-xyz/superform-core/pull/641.

### 3. Gas - Write an ad hoc `_updateSuperformData()` for single vault deposits

#### Technical Details

In [`completeCrossChainReblance()`](https://github.com/superform-xyz/superform-core/blob/f7f06d763a6af148899e9c292f1a57414db60cc3/src/router-plus/SuperformRouterPlusAsync.sol#L221) the keeper updates the user data with his data. A cast to a `MultiVaultSFData` is an intermediate step in single vault deposits. This is done to have a unified return type from [`_updateSuperformData()`](https://github.com/superform-xyz/superform-core/blob/f7f06d763a6af148899e9c292f1a57414db60cc3/src/router-plus/SuperformRouterPlusAsync.sol#L476). However, it is more gas efficient to write an ad-hoc function for single vault deposit scenarios.

#### Impact

Gas savings.

#### Recommendation

Write an `_updateSuperformData()` that returns `SingleVaultSFData` for single vault deposit scenarios. You can then delete [`_castToMultiVaultData()`](https://github.com/superform-xyz/superform-core/blob/f7f06d763a6af148899e9c292f1a57414db60cc3/src/router-plus/SuperformRouterPlusAsync.sol#L546-L567) and [`_castUint256ToArray()`](https://github.com/superform-xyz/superform-core/blob/f7f06d763a6af148899e9c292f1a57414db60cc3/src/router-plus/SuperformRouterPlusAsync.sol#L569-L572), as they are no longer necessary.

```solidity
function _updateSuperformData(
    SingleVaultSFData memory sfData,
    LiqRequest memory liqRequest,

### 4. Gas - Resetting approvals to zero can be omitted

#### Technical Details

In [`rebalance()`](https://github.com/superform-xyz/SuperVaults/blob/99382c369aa68a2e5666e2ee4045f32cd8bc3f3e/src/SuperVault.sol#L154) and [`_freeFunds()`](https://github.com/superform-xyz/SuperVaults/blob/99382c369aa68a2e5666e2ee4045f32cd8bc3f3e/src/SuperVault.sol#L302) approvals are reset to zero [here](https://github.com/superform-xyz/SuperVaults/blob/99382c369aa68a2e5666e2ee4045f32cd8bc3f3e/src/SuperVault.sol#L206) and [here](https://github.com/superform-xyz/SuperVaults/blob/99382c369aa68a2e5666e2ee4045f32cd8bc3f3e/src/SuperVault.sol#L318-L321) after routerPlus and router calls. However, this is unnecessary because allowances are decreased after routers use their allowance.

#### Impact

Gas savings.

#### Recommendation

Remove unnecessary allowance resets.

#### Developer Response

Fixed in https://github.com/superform-xyz/SuperVaults/pull/12.

### 5. Gas - Get the address of the Superform directly

#### Technical Details

At various places in the `SuperVault` the [`getSuperform()`](https://github.com/superform-xyz/SuperVaults/blob/99382c369aa68a2e5666e2ee4045f32cd8bc3f3e/src/SuperVault.sol#L111) utility function is called. This function gets the Superfrom address, the form implementation ID, and the chain ID for a given Superform ID. However, in the `SuperVault`, only the Superform address is used.

#### Impact

Gas Savings

#### Recommendation

Cast the Superform ID to an address directly rather than using the `getSuperform()` utility.

#### Developer Response

Acknownledged.

## Informational Findings

### 1. Informational - Throw appropriate errors

#### Technical Details

A wrong error is thrown in [`disputeRefund()`](https://github.com/superform-xyz/superform-core/blob/f7f06d763a6af148899e9c292f1a57414db60cc3/src/router-plus/SuperformRouterPlusAsync.sol#L425) when the condition `r.proposedTime == 0` is met. This happens when the refund is already disputed and not when the dispute time has elapsed.

#### Impact

Informational.

#### Recommendation

Throw an appropriate error:

```diff
-        if (r.proposedTime == 0 || block.timestamp > r.proposedTime + _getDelay()) revert Error.DISPUTE_TIME_ELAPSED();
+        if (r.proposedTime == 0) revert Error.REFUND_ALREADY_DISPUTED();
+        if (block.timestamp > r.proposedTime + _getDelay()) revert Error.DISPUTE_TIME_ELAPSED();
```

#### Developer Response

This error has been removed due to the refund mechanism refactor.

### 2. Informational - Remove unused imports

#### Technical Details

- [`SuperformFactory`](https://github.com/superform-xyz/superform-core/blob/f7f06d763a6af148899e9c292f1a57414db60cc3/src/router-plus/SuperformRouterPlusAsync.sol#L21C10-L21C27) import is unused.
- [`DataTypes`](https://github.com/superform-xyz/superform-core/blob/f7f06d763a6af148899e9c292f1a57414db60cc3/src/router-plus/SuperformRouterPlus.sol#L8) import is unused.

#### Impact

Informational.

#### Recommendation

Remove unused imports.

#### Developer Response

Fixed in https://github.com/superform-xyz/SuperVaults/pull/10.

### 3. Informational - MsgValue variables are not needed in SuperVaults

#### Technical Details

In [`rebalance()`](https://github.com/superform-xyz/SuperVaults/blob/99382c369aa68a2e5666e2ee4045f32cd8bc3f3e/src/SuperVault.sol#L154-L212) `rebalanceFromMsgValue` and `rebalanceToMsgValue` are not needed because the transaction is done in the same chain with the same underlying.

#### Impact

Informational.

#### Recommendation

Remove both variables from the process flow.

#### Developer Response

Fixed in https://github.com/superform-xyz/SuperVaults/commit/0e02bde141522456100041fbf8c6784c7809a6e6.

### 4. Informational - `TODO` left in the code

#### Technical Details

https://github.com/superform-xyz/SuperVaults/blob/99382c369aa68a2e5666e2ee4045f32cd8bc3f3e/src/SuperVault.sol#L486

#### Impact

Informational.

#### Recommendation

Make sure all of the todos are done.

#### Developer Response

Fixed in https://github.com/superform-xyz/SuperVaults/pull/12.

### 5. Informational - `refundReceiver` can be removed

#### Technical Details

In `SuperVault`, a `refundReceiver` variable receives refunds from hypothetical reverts during deposits. However, `SuperVault` doesn't support cross-chain deposits. All deposits are synchronous and revert during failures without needing to emit refunds. This means the `refundReceiver` is not useful and can be removed.

#### Impact

Informational.

#### Recommendation

Delete `refundReceiver` and its setter function.

#### Developer Response

Fixed in https://github.com/superform-xyz/SuperVaults/pull/12/commits/4c3ff28d99941eb09452cc0612aa8e4f43d375dc.

### 6. Informational - Fix typos

#### Technical Details

[src/SuperVault.sol#328](https://github.com/superform-xyz/SuperVaults/blob/99382c369aa68a2e5666e2ee4045f32cd8bc3f3e/src/SuperVault.sol#L328)

```diff
+        /// @dev thus this function will be unused (we just report full assets)
-        /// @dev thus this function we will be unused (we just report full assets)
```

#### Impact

Informational.

#### Recommendation

Fix typos.

#### Developer Response

Fixed in https://github.com/superform-xyz/SuperVaults/pull/8.

## Final Remarks

This audit provides a comprehensive review of the new contracts that will be part of the Superform system. While some issues related to a possible non-trusted keeper must be addressed, the overall code and testing suite demonstrate a solid foundation.
