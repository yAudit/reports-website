## Review Summary

**asymmetry veASF**

Asymmetry veASF provides token locking and fee distributor contracts for the ASF token.

The contracts of the asymmetry veASF [Repo](https://github.com/asymmetryfinance/veASF) were reviewed over 5 days. The code review was performed by 2 auditors between 27 May and 31 May 2024. The repository was under active development during the review, but the review was limited to the latest commit at the start of the review. This was commit [969dd707ac096737e69061fda84951c8518d2601](https://github.com/asymmetryfinance/veASF/commit/969dd707ac096737e69061fda84951c8518d2601) for the veASF repo.

## Scope

The scope of the review consisted of the following contracts at the specific commit:

```
src
├── AsfToken.sol
├── FeeDistributor.sol
├── TokenLocker.sol
├── interfaces
│   └── ITokenLocker.sol
└── utils
    ├── DelegatedOps.sol
    └── SystemStart.sol
```

After the findings were presented to the asymmetry team, fixes were made and included in several PRs.

This review is a code review to identify potential vulnerabilities in the code. The reviewers did not investigate security practices or operational security and assumed that privileged accounts could be trusted. The reviewers did not evaluate the security of the code relative to a standard or specification. The review may not have identified all potential attack vectors or areas of vulnerability.

yAudit and the auditors make no warranties regarding the security of the code and do not warrant that the code is free from defects. yAudit and the auditors do not represent nor imply to third parties that the code has been audited nor that the code is free from defects. By deploying or using the code, asymmetry veASF and users of the contracts agree to use the code at their own risk.

## Gas Saving Findings

### 1. Gas - Use unsafe math

Unsafe math can be used to increase gas efficiency.

#### Technical Details

```solidity
File: src/TokenLocker.sol

517 | uint256 increase = (_newWeeks - _weeks) * _amount;

655 | increasedWeight += (newWeeks - oldWeeks) * amount;

822 | accountData.unlocked = uint32((unlocked - amountToWithdraw) / lockToTokenRatio);
```


[src/TokenLocker.sol#L517](https://github.com/asymmetryfinance/veASF/tree/969dd707ac096737e69061fda84951c8518d2601/src/TokenLocker.sol#L517), [src/TokenLocker.sol#L655](https://github.com/asymmetryfinance/veASF/tree/969dd707ac096737e69061fda84951c8518d2601/src/TokenLocker.sol#L655), [src/TokenLocker.sol#L822](https://github.com/asymmetryfinance/veASF/tree/969dd707ac096737e69061fda84951c8518d2601/src/TokenLocker.sol#L822)

```solidity
File: src/FeeDistributor.sol

122 | uint256 amount = (weeklyFeeAmounts[token][i] * weight) / totalWeight;

135 | uint256 amount = (weeklyFeeAmounts[token][i] * weight) / totalWeight;

284 | claimableAmount += (feeAmount * weight) / totalWeight;
```

[src/FeeDistributor.sol#L122](https://github.com/asymmetryfinance/veASF/tree/969dd707ac096737e69061fda84951c8518d2601/src/FeeDistributor.sol#L122), [src/FeeDistributor.sol#L135](https://github.com/asymmetryfinance/veASF/tree/969dd707ac096737e69061fda84951c8518d2601/src/FeeDistributor.sol#L135), [src/FeeDistributor.sol#L284](https://github.com/asymmetryfinance/veASF/tree/969dd707ac096737e69061fda84951c8518d2601/src/FeeDistributor.sol#L284)

#### Impact

Gas savings.

#### Recommendation

Use  `unchecked {}` for subtraction and divisions.

#### Developer Response

Will not implement.

### 2. Gas - Consider using a right-shift operator instead of a division

`<x> / 256` can be replaced with `<x> >> 8` for equivalent results but a lower gas cost.

#### Technical Details

There are a lot of divisions by 265 in the codebase. 256 is equal to 2**8; the following change could, for example, be made:

```diff
File: src/TokenLocker.sol

- 182 | bitfield = accountData.updateWeeks[accountWeek / 256];
+ 182 | bitfield = accountData.updateWeeks[accountWeek >> 8];
```

#### Impact

Gas savings.

#### Recommendation

Use bit-shifting instead of divisions.

#### Developer Response

implemented at https://github.com/asymmetryfinance/veASF/pull/3/commits/535755b1876b2d1f560b71d5635af1c8c20b010f

### 3. Gas - Cache `currentWeek` in `withdrawWithPenalty()`

#### Technical Details

In the function [`withdrawWithPenalty()`](https://github.com/asymmetryfinance/veASF/blob/969dd707ac096737e69061fda84951c8518d2601/src/TokenLocker.sol#L812-L812) the function `getWeek()` is called twice.

Caching the first call in a `currentWeek` variable and using it at the end instead of calling `getWeek()` again would save some gas.

#### Impact

Gas.

#### Recommendation

Save roughly 100 gas by caching `getWeek()` instead of calling it twice.

```solidity
uint256 currentWeek = getWeek();
uint256 systemWeek = currentWeek;
```

[L890](https://github.com/asymmetryfinance/veASF/blob/969dd707ac096737e69061fda84951c8518d2601/src/TokenLocker.sol#L890-L890):
```solidity
accountWeeklyWeights[msg.sender][currentWeek] = uint40(weight - decreasedWeight);
totalWeeklyWeights[currentWeek] = uint40(getTotalWeightWrite() - decreasedWeight);
```

#### Developer Response

Implemented at https://github.com/asymmetryfinance/veASF/pull/3/commits/52c9fb7cde83323b35ec872cf0ffa89101217112

## Informational Findings

### 1. Informational - if statement can be converted to a ternary

The code can be made more compact while also increasing readability by converting the following `if`-statements to ternaries (e.g., `foo += (x > y) ? a : b`)

#### Technical Details

```solidity
File: src/TokenLocker.sol

181 | if (accountWeek % 256 == 0) {
182 |                     bitfield = accountData.updateWeeks[accountWeek / 256];
183 |                 } else {
184 |                     bitfield = bitfield >> 1;
185 |                 }

226 | if (accountWeek % 256 == 0) {
227 |                 bitfield = accountData.updateWeeks[accountWeek / 256];
228 |             } else {
229 |                 bitfield = bitfield >> 1;
230 |             }

270 | if (currentWeek % 256 == 0) {
271 |                     bitfield = accountData.updateWeeks[currentWeek / 256];
272 |                 } else {
273 |                     bitfield = bitfield >> 1;
274 |                 }

938 | if (accountWeek % 256 == 0) {
939 |                 bitfield = accountData.updateWeeks[accountWeek / 256];
940 |             } else {
941 |                 bitfield = bitfield >> 1;
942 |             }
```

#### Impact

Informational

#### Recommendation

Use ternary to improve code.

#### Developer Response

### 2. Informational - Avoid redundant return statements

When a function includes a named return variable, a return statement becomes redundant and should not be included.

#### Technical Details

```solidity
File: src/FeeDistributor.sol

92 | return amounts;

224 | return claimedAmounts;

268 | return claimedAmounts;

286 | return claimableAmount;
```

[src/FeeDistributor.sol#L92](https://github.com/asymmetryfinance/veASF/tree/969dd707ac096737e69061fda84951c8518d2601/src/FeeDistributor.sol#L92), [src/FeeDistributor.sol#L224](https://github.com/asymmetryfinance/veASF/tree/969dd707ac096737e69061fda84951c8518d2601/src/FeeDistributor.sol#L224), [src/FeeDistributor.sol#L268](https://github.com/asymmetryfinance/veASF/tree/969dd707ac096737e69061fda84951c8518d2601/src/FeeDistributor.sol#L268), [src/FeeDistributor.sol#L286](https://github.com/asymmetryfinance/veASF/tree/969dd707ac096737e69061fda84951c8518d2601/src/FeeDistributor.sol#L286)

```solidity
File: src/TokenLocker.sol

194 | return (locked, unlocked);

286 | return (lockData, frozenAmount);

361 | return (amountToWithdraw, penaltyTotal);

958 | return weight;
```

[src/TokenLocker.sol#L194](https://github.com/asymmetryfinance/veASF/tree/969dd707ac096737e69061fda84951c8518d2601/src/TokenLocker.sol#L194), [src/TokenLocker.sol#L286](https://github.com/asymmetryfinance/veASF/tree/969dd707ac096737e69061fda84951c8518d2601/src/TokenLocker.sol#L286), [src/TokenLocker.sol#L361](https://github.com/asymmetryfinance/veASF/tree/969dd707ac096737e69061fda84951c8518d2601/src/TokenLocker.sol#L361), [src/TokenLocker.sol#L958](https://github.com/asymmetryfinance/veASF/tree/969dd707ac096737e69061fda84951c8518d2601/src/TokenLocker.sol#L958)


#### Impact
Informational

#### Recommendation

Implemented some at https://github.com/asymmetryfinance/veASF/pull/3/commits/b257342ba2067929cf3cf6138a4f4b3c429fd52b


### 3. Informational - Missing check for address(0x0) when adding a new token to FeeDistributor

`registerNewFeeToken()` should not accept the address zero as a parameter.

#### Technical Details

```solidity
File: src/FeeDistributor.sol

155 | feeTokenData[token] = FeeTokenData({ isRegistered: true, firstWeek: uint16(getWeek()), lastWeek: 0 });
```

[src/FeeDistributor.sol#L155](https://github.com/asymmetryfinance/veASF/tree/969dd707ac096737e69061fda84951c8518d2601/src/FeeDistributor.sol#L155)

#### Impact

Infoamtional

#### Recommendation

Make sure the token is not the zero address.

#### Developer Response

Implemented at https://github.com/asymmetryfinance/veASF/pull/3/commits/cc1a98dfadb73051b3d004b01379fd5e57ed91e6


### 4. Informational - Make sure `feeReceiver` can't be set to zero

The ASF token implementation will revert if a token transfer is made to the zero address.
The constructor and setFeeReceiver function are not preventing the `feeReceiver` from being set to the zero address. Setting it to the zero address will break `withdrawWithPenalty()`.

#### Technical Details
```solidity
153 |    function setFeeReceiver(address _receiver) external onlyOwner returns (bool) {
154 |        feeReceiver = _receiver;
155 |        return true;
156 |    }
```

[TokenLocker.sol#L153-L156](https://github.com/asymmetryfinance/veASF/blob/d57e48c9488488559d2bb3900e2187e113f617bd/src/TokenLocker.sol#L153-L156)

#### Impact

Informational

#### Recommendation

Add a check to ensure the admin isn't setting `feeReceiver` to the zero address.

#### Developer Response

Implemented at https://github.com/asymmetryfinance/veASF/pull/3/commits/89dc09dce62cacc8b9d74bb380892947926457e4


### 5. Informational - Enforce `startTime * 1 weeks == 0` in `SystemStart`

#### Technical Details

In the contract `SystemStart`, the `startTime` is supposed to be a timestamp on Thursday at 00:00:00 GMT.

This is because the UNIX timestamp starts at this time [this way the `TokenLocker` contract can enforce locks to be 2 weeks when locking in the last 3 days of the week](https://github.com/asymmetryfinance/veASF/blob/969dd707ac096737e69061fda84951c8518d2601/src/TokenLocker.sol#L469-L469).

It is crucial that the timestamp passed is correct, as it could otherwise allow users to lock for one week less than three days before the end of the week.

#### Impact

Informational.

#### Recommendation

Add a check `startTime * 1 weeks == 0` in the constructor and revert if `false`.

#### Developer Response

Implemented at https://github.com/asymmetryfinance/veASF/pull/3/commits/832aba854a15287ef3459944acf8c3a807976d06


### 6. Informational - Users may be locked longer than expected

#### Technical Details

When a user lock his tokens for 1 week during the last 3 days of the epoch his lock is directly set to 2 weeks instead in the function [`_lock()`](https://github.com/asymmetryfinance/veASF/blob/969dd707ac096737e69061fda84951c8518d2601/src/TokenLocker.sol#L469-L469).

This results in users expecting to be locked for 3 days or less but being locked for 7 to 10 days.

#### Impact

Informational.

#### Recommendation

Consider reverting when a user shouldn't be able to lock for 1 week instead of setting the lock to 2 weeks.

#### Developer Response

Will not implement

## Final remarks

In conclusion, the audit of the asymmetry veASF contracts identified several areas for improvement. The changes made to the original codebase from which the project was forked didn't result in any important vulnerabilities. The recommendations primarily focused on enhancing gas efficiency, improving code readability, and adding additional safeguards to prevent potential issues.
